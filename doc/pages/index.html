<p>
    ANY styleguide specific component must be styled by using a prefixed class: .docs--what-ever-button!
</p>
<p>
    Make sure to follow existing pages markup structure. Especially xray-html is a little tricky.
</p>
<p>
    If your example requires some specific styling, write that in a &lt;style&gt; directly in the document.
